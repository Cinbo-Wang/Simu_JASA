This repository contains codes for regenerating the simulation data in our paper "Covariate Adjustment in Randomized Clinical Trials with GLMs: On the Role of Jackknife and Practical Recommendations".

- Main.R: This file contains the simulation settings in the main text and supplementary. Methods compared including  $\hat{\tau}_{\gob}$ and its calibrated version $\hat{\tau}_{\gbcal}$ \citep{guo2023generalized, bannick2025general}; standard LOO estimators including $\hat{\tau}_{\loo}$ \citep{wu2018loop, cohen2024no}, and its two calibrated versions $\hat{\tau}_{\loocal}$ \citep{cohen2024no} and $\hat{\tau}_{\loocalout}$.
